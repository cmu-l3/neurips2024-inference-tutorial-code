# Section 1: Token-level generation

In this section, we present example useage of **token-level** generation techniques using the `guidance` library.

## Files

- Thy Python notebook `constrained_decoding.ipynb` contains example use of constrained decoding methods using the `guidance` library.
- `prompt_boundaries_and_token_healing.ipynb` is adapted from [an example notebook in the guidance docs](https://guidance.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_notebooks/art_of_prompt_design/prompt_boundaries_and_token_healing.html) and demonstrates how to overcome tokenization issues in templated generation.
